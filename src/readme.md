===== generally the Dapp offers confidentiality as a service ===

System architecture

Auth
    -> under this we need to obtain the users wallet address - using braavos or argentx
    -> ask for user's username and then their email aswell
    -> after that trigger an event letting user know that they have signed up on the Dapp
    -> user confirms then you can redirect them to the upload section.


Upload section
    -> Hit the upload button
    -> after uploading indicate that it was successful, NFT upload success
    -> redirect to the NFTs list
    -> add trustee button on the NFTs

Add Trustee
    -> Ask for the email of the trustee  to be added.
